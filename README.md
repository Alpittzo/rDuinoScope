# rDuinoScope
I'm working on a mount project using rDuinoScope.
I have an issue with the touch controls, the X and Y axis of the touch function are inverted (when I want to press a button in bottom left corner for example I have to press top right corner etc.)
If anyone knows how to fix this or where I'm going wrong some advice/help would be hugely appreciated!
