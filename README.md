# rDuinoScope
my mount project using rDuinoScope
So I have an issue with compiling the code for my rDuinoScope based project, I'm using the ElecHouse 3.2" TFT LCD 240*400 touch screen,
with the TFT Shield V2.1, and each time I add the Library for it from Elechouse (see below) the compiling fails, without it it works everytime, but the touch function isnt working. I'll the code and the compiling errors.
#include <pin_magic.h>
#include <tftlib.h>
